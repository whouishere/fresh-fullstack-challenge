# Cubo's Fullstack Challenge

In this attempt to recreate [Cubo's Fullstack Challenge](https://github.com/cubonetwork/fullstack-challenge), I chose to use [Deno](https://deno.land) as the language runtime and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) as the front-end and back-end framework.

Once I got to try out TypeScript I couldn't stand JavaScript more than I already didn't. This combined with Deno's incredibly fast and minimal approach to... everything made it an interesting choice for me. After all, I wanted to actually try to do a real project with it.

## Usage

Start the project with:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart Deno on file changes.
